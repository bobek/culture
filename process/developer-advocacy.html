<h2><a class="header" href="#goal" id="goal">Goal</a></h2>
<p>To build MayaData technical brand with deep, meaningful conversations on engineering topics relevant to our industry by <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120625174339/http://meghangill.com:80/2012/06/11/why-invest-in-communit-leaders/">leveraging our community</a> of team-members and the wider ecosystem.</p>
<ul>
<li>The ideal ratio of MayaData team-members to the wider community members should be 20:80. Currently we are more like 95:5. Our challenge is to solve for this while ensuring our presence in key industry events and online forums.</li>
<li>Increase the adoption of MayaData products and influence the product development suited towards SRE and DevOps personas. </li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#why-push-the-wider-community" id="why-push-the-wider-community">Why push the wider community?</a></h2>
<p>Meghan Gill, former developer marketing leader at MongoDB and current VP of Sales Ops there, is a champion of leveraging the community. The reasons she gives are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The psychological reason: Messages about a product are always more powerful coming from a user.</li>
<li>The economic reason: By investing in a community member and helping them become a great evangelist, we spend once and continually reap benefits. However, when we send team-members to conferences, we take time away from their daily jobs slowing down product development. Each time a team member leaves their desk, there is an opportunity cost which we do not have to pay with a community member.</li>
<li>The sustainability reason: Once we enable community members to have a voice in the ecosystem, there is a snowball effect and they get invited to present their point of view repeatedly. Our investment is largely done but the benefit keeps coming back.</li>
<li>The amplification reason: There is no way one company can reach everyone. However, with community evangelists in place, they can amplify the reach beyond a company’s corridors of influence.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#who-can-be-a-developer-advocate" id="who-can-be-a-developer-advocate">Who can be a Developer Advocate?</a></h2>
<p>Everybody in wider MayaData Community can be a Developer Advocate. Whether you work in marketing, ops or engineering, you have a point of view on the work you do and the ecosystem of open source enterprise technology. If you are looking for ideas to get started, reach out on #dac slack channel or look for open items under <a href="https://github.com/orgs/mayadata-io/projects/2">Community Interactions project</a>. </p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#stages-of-developer-advocacy" id="stages-of-developer-advocacy">Stages of Developer Advocacy</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Beginner - when you start following the right accounts on Twitter, peruse HN regularly, and respond to people</li>
<li>Enthusiast - when you start creating content in the form of blog posts, videos, tweets, talks. Occasionally you create issues whenever you want to post something on the company blog or Medium publication.</li>
<li>Pro - when you are invited to give talks that have over 200 attendees, when your content sometimes goes viral, often snagging over 500 views. You regularly contribute to the MayaData blog and other community blogs, podcasts, other content channels. At this point, you are looking at becoming a full time developer advocate.
