<h2><a class="header" href="#scope-and-goals" id="scope-and-goals">Scope and goals</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The documents here should expand  the <a href="https://medium.com/mayadata/mayadatas-secret-5-step-plan-for-world-domination-3c02ac8b097a">MayaData secret plan for world domination</a> and convert the plan into a culture we aspire to achieve as well as concrete actions to implement and measure adoption of the culture</li>
<li>The documents here are expected to bring all the leads and the entire company onto a common understanding and provide a guiding framework for day-to-day prioritization decisions.</li>
<li>The main culture changes we want to bring in into the company, mainly in engineering with the focus on the lessons learned from previous product development and stay ahead in terms of features and quality</li>
<li>One of the key aspects of the company is people and the kind of people we bring in. These document define the details for retaining existing members, hiring new team members, and how to insure that the work environment for all contributors is one in which they feel able to make an immediate and measurable difference.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#culture-definition" id="culture-definition">Culture definition</a></h2>
<p><em>Culture is a framework that is used for day-to-day interactions and decision making. When in conflict, the culture established and accepted is used to resolve differences.</em></p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#why-are-we-writing-this-document" id="why-are-we-writing-this-document">Why are we writing this document?</a></h2>
<p>Culture can be a secret ingredient that increases user adoption, product quality, employee engagement and well being. By writing down our shared assumptions and aspirations about our culture, we hope to improve and sustain our culture as our company grows and transforms to better address user needs.</p>
<p>History shows that employees either leave or really invest their best selves into organizations depending on the culture.  Our values help us to prevent the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Five_Dysfunctions_of_a_Team#Summary">five dysfunctions</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Absence of trust (unwilling to be vulnerable within the group) =&gt; prevented by people first, specifically kindness</li>
<li>Fear of conflict (seeking artificial harmony over constructive passionate debate) =&gt; prevented by openness, specifically directness</li>
<li>Lack of commitment (feigning buy-in for group decisions creates ambiguity throughout the organization) =&gt; prevented by openness, specifically directness</li>
<li>Avoidance of accountability (ducking the responsibility to call peers on counterproductive behavior which sets low standards) =&gt; prevented by winning, and openness</li>
<li>Inattention to results (focusing on personal success, status and ego before team success) =&gt; prevented by people first and winning</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#our-mission" id="our-mission">Our Mission:</a></h2>
<p>We want MayaData to be the preferred place to work for engineers, computer scientists, community advocates and others that believe in our company mission to limit cloud lock-in while providing higher levels of control of the data layer to DevOps teams. We recognize that in order to achieve our mission we have to be the <em><strong>best team</strong></em> possible at <em><strong>building</strong></em> and <em><strong>running</strong></em> the <em><strong>right software</strong></em> based solutions to our customer’s problems.   We commit to always working to improve MayaData - and ourselves - to delight our customers.  Our culture plays a key role in achieving this mission.</p>
<p>Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>When we talk about the <em><strong>best team possible</strong></em> we emphasize that we expect high degrees of collaboration and teamwork; if you cannot work with a team with multiple cultures with high degrees of sensitivity then we are likely not the right place for you.  We seek to be the preferred employer for the best contributors in Bangalore and other markets in which we hire.</li>
<li>When we talk about <em><strong>building software</strong></em> we emphasize that we focus on the productivity of our engineering teams and will be relentless in improving their ability to respond to customers quickly.  We will aggressively seek to continuously improve our CI/CD and operations abilities for example.</li>
<li>When we talk about <em><strong>running software</strong></em> we emphasize a DevOps approach so that if you write the code, you support the customers and you lead efforts to fix any bugs.</li>
<li>When we talk about <em><strong>the right software</strong></em> we emphasize listening to users.  We believe everyone at MayaData can learn from users and customers and that the best learning comes from users actually using software as opposed to simply talking about it.  In order to learn from internal users, we believe in <em>dog fooding</em> which is the practice by which we will always use our own software if it is at all applicable to our use cases.  Development environments, staging, and CI/CD and of course operations should all be based on OpenEBS and OpenEBS Director.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a class="header" href="#about-our-values" id="about-our-values">About our Values</a></h2>
<p>We take inspiration from other companies, and we always go for solutions that are easy to implement. Just like the rest of our work, we continually adjust our values and strive always to make them better. Everyone is welcome to suggest improvements.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#people-first" id="people-first">People First</a></h2>
<p>All business - and arguably life itself - comes down to people.  Whether working with our team, or the community, or customers, or partners or others - we strive to remember and to reinforce our common humanity.</p>
<p>Helping others is a priority, even when it is not immediately related to the goals that you are trying to achieve. Similarly, you can rely on others for help and advice - in fact; you're expected to do so. Anyone can chime in on any subject, just like in good families. As companies grow their speed of decision making goes down since there are more people involved. When you are the person who’s responsible for the work, you decide how to do it, but you should always take the suggestions seriously and try to respond and explain why it may or may not have been implemented.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#make-someones-day-today" id="make-someones-day-today">Make someone’s day today</a></h3>
<p>It is a long journey. Over time happy team members are healthier, productive and bring positivity to others. Remember, we all want to be in a group where we are happy. Be thoughtful and kind just because you can. Catch people doing things right. Help a team member who's having a difficult time or need mentors. Be a good listener. Share your joy.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#kindness" id="kindness">Kindness</a></h3>
<p>We value caring for others. Give as much positive feedback as you can and do it in a public way.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#say-thanks" id="say-thanks">Say thanks</a></h3>
<p>Recognize the people that helped you publicly, for example in our #say-thanks chat channel or via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/95698/sending-a-kudos-post-on-linkedin?lang=en">LinkedIn Give Kudos</a>.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#negative-is-1-1" id="negative-is-1-1">Negative is 1-1</a></h3>
<p>Give negative feedback in the smallest setting possible, one-on-one video calls are preferred. Remember, we are all on the same boat. And the purpose of negative feedback is not to hurt a person, it is go get MayaData better and better and win together and to help that person learn and progress.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#speakup" id="speakup">Speakup</a></h3>
<p>If you are unhappy with anything (your duties, your colleague, your boss, your salary, your location, your computer, the sloppiness of a colleague, or anything else) please let your boss, or the CEO, know as soon as you realize it. We want to solve problems while they are <em>small</em>.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#get-to-know-each-other" id="get-to-know-each-other">Get to know each other</a></h3>
<p>We use a lot of Slack communication and if you know the person behind the text it will be easier to prevent conflicts. Please help encourage people to get to know each other on a personal level through our team calls, virtual coffee breaks, events and during company gatherings.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#give-feedback-effectively" id="give-feedback-effectively">Give feedback effectively</a></h3>
<p>Giving feedback is challenging, but it's important to deliver it effectively. When providing feedback, always make it about the work itself; focus on the business impact and not the person. Make sure to provide at least one clear and recent example. If a person is going through a hard time in their personal life, then take that into account. An example of giving positive feedback is our #say-thanks chat channel. For managers, it's important to realize that employees react to a negative incident with their managers <a href="https://hbr.org/2013/03/the-delicate-art-of-giving-fee">six times more strongly</a> than they do to a positive one. Keeping that in mind, if an error is so inconsequential that the value gained from providing criticism is low, it might make sense to keep that feedback to yourself. In the situations where negative feedback must be given, focus on the purpose for that feedback: to improve the employee’s performance going forward. Give <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?infotype=SA&amp;subtype=WH&amp;htmlfid=LOW14298USEN">recognition generously</a>, in the open, and often to generate more engagement from your team</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#dont-pull-rank" id="dont-pull-rank">Don't pull rank</a></h3>
<p>If you have to remind someone of the position you have in the company you're doing something wrong, people already know we have a hierarchical decision making process. Explain why you're making the decision and respect everyone irrespective of their function.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#dont-label-other-teams" id="dont-label-other-teams">Don’t label other teams</a></h3>
<p>An anti pattern that counters being people first is being “group first”.  Beware the rise of capitalized words to identify groups of unclearly defined “others.”  For example, avoid phrases like “Support just does not understand our code” or “Engineering does not care about us.”  Similarly, remember there is one team (and yes one system…) and that this MayaData team is comprised of all of us plus the community of users, customers and partners.  So avoid prioritizing the needs of ones own immediate coworkers over what is best for the user, company, community and other stakeholders.  <strong>When in doubt prioritize the needs of the user and especially customers above all else.</strong></p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#assume-positive-intent" id="assume-positive-intent">Assume positive intent</a></h3>
<p>We naturally have a double standard when it comes to the actions of others. We blame circumstances for our own mistakes, but individuals for theirs. This double standard is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error">Fundamental Attribution Error</a>. In order to mitigate this bias you should always assume <a href="https://www.collaborativeway.com/general/a-ceos-advice-assume-positive-intent/">positive intent</a> in your interactions with others, respecting their expertise and giving them grace in the face of what you might perceive as mistakes.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#address-behavior-but-dont-label-people" id="address-behavior-but-dont-label-people">Address behavior, but don't label people</a></h3>
<p>There is a lot of good in this <a href="http://bobsutton.typepad.com/my_weblog/2006/10/the_no_asshole_.html">article</a> about not wanting jerks on our team, but we believe that jerk is a label for behavior rather than an inherent classification of a person. We avoid classifications.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#say-sorry" id="say-sorry">Say sorry</a></h3>
<p>If you made a mistake, apologize. Saying sorry is not a sign of weakness but one of strength. The people that do the most work will likely make the most mistakes. Additionally, when we share our mistakes and bring attention to them, others can learn from us, and the same mistake is less likely to be repeated by someone else.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#no-ego" id="no-ego">No ego</a></h3>
<p>Don't defend a point to win an argument or double-down on a mistake. You are not your work; you don't have to defend your point. You do have to search for the right answer with help from others.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#people-are-not-their-work" id="people-are-not-their-work">People are not their work</a></h3>
<p>Always make suggestions about examples of work, not the person. Say, &quot;you didn't respond to my feedback about the design&quot; instead of &quot;you never listen&quot;. And, when receiving feedback, keep in mind that feedback is the best way to improve and that others want to see you succeed.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#blameless-problem-solving" id="blameless-problem-solving">Blameless problem solving</a></h3>
<p>Investigate mistakes in a way that focuses on the situational aspects of a failure’s mechanism and the decision-making process that led to the failure rather than cast blame on a person or team. We hold blameless <a href="https://codeascraft.com/2012/05/22/blameless-postmortems/">root cause analyses</a> and <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/management/team-retrospectives/">retrospectives</a> for stakeholders to speak up without fear of punishment or retribution.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#dogfooding" id="dogfooding">Dogfooding</a></h3>
<p>We <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food">use our own product</a>. Our SaaS service uses data management and tools that we deliver to our customers. We upgrade to the latest version before publishing it for general consumption.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#diversity-and-inclusion-are-fundamental-to-the-success-of-mayadata" id="diversity-and-inclusion-are-fundamental-to-the-success-of-mayadata">Diversity and inclusion are fundamental to the success of MayaData.</a></h3>
<p>We aim to make a significant impact in our efforts to foster an environment where everyone can thrive. We actively chose to build and institutionalize a culture that is inclusive and supports all employees equally in the process of achieving their professional goals. We hire globally and encourage hiring in a diverse set of countries. We work to make everyone feel welcome and to increase the participation of underrepresented minorities and nationalities in our community and company.</p>
<p>Do not make jokes or unfriendly remarks about race, ethnic origin, skin color, gender, or sexual orientation. Everyone has the right to feel safe when working for MayaData. We do not tolerate abuse, harassment, exclusion, discrimination or retaliation by/of any community members, including our employees. You can always refuse to deal with people who treat you badly and get out of situations that make you feel uncomfortable.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#shift-working-hours-for-a-cause" id="shift-working-hours-for-a-cause">Shift working hours for a cause</a></h3>
<p>Caregiving, outreach programs, and community service do not conveniently wait for regular business hours to conclude. If there's a cause or community effort taking place, feel welcome to work with your manager and shift your working hours to be available during a period where you'll have the greatest impact for good. For colleagues supporting others during these causes, document everything and strive to post recordings so it's easy for them to catch up.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#be-a-mentor" id="be-a-mentor">Be a mentor</a></h3>
<p>People feel more included when they're supported.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#family-and-friends-first-work-second" id="family-and-friends-first-work-second">Family and friends first, work second</a></h3>
<p>Long lasting relationships are the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_N_uvq41Pg">rocks of life</a> and come before work.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#celebrate-accomplishments-with-offsite-events" id="celebrate-accomplishments-with-offsite-events">Celebrate accomplishments with offsite events</a></h3>
<p>While being frugal about spending, we also make opportunities for celebrating our accomplishments and bonding with other team members over offsite events. Our ambition is to have an all-company annual offsite meeting in the coming years. Until that happens, we will make sure the people in closer geographic circles will have quarterly events. For instance, an offsite lunch in the first and third quarters, an offsite weekend outing in the second quarter, and half-day fun activities in the fourth quarter.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#listen-to-learn" id="listen-to-learn">Listen to learn</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#listen-to-users" id="listen-to-users">Listen to users</a></h3>
<p>Listen to users in the openebs-users, sig-storage, kubernetes / litmus channels and various other social channels online and offline, ask clarifying questions and even just ask them whether your understanding is correct by using phrases like “can you confirm that I got it right?  You are experiencing X and would like to understand Y?”. Learn and document the use cases that users are trying to solve.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#listen-to-peers" id="listen-to-peers">Listen to peers</a></h3>
<p>Listen to peers and their fears about the solution. The fears may be founded on the research and experience they bring. Validate possible solutions by talking to users.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#its-impossible-to-know-everything" id="its-impossible-to-know-everything">It's impossible to know everything</a></h3>
<p>We know we must rely on others for the expertise they have that we don't. It's ok to admit you don't know something and to ask for help, even if doing so makes you feel vulnerable. It is never too late to ask a question, and by doing so you can get the information you need to produce results and to strengthen your own skills as well as Mayadata as a whole. After your question is answered, please document the answer so that it can be shared. Don't display surprise when people say they don't know something, as it is important that everyone feels comfortable saying &quot;I don't know&quot; and &quot;I don't understand.&quot; (As inspired by <a href="https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules">Recurse</a>.)</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#remove-rigid-barriers-around-your-domain" id="remove-rigid-barriers-around-your-domain">Remove rigid barriers around your domain.</a></h3>
<p>People joining the company frequently are hesitant to provide feedback. At MayaData we should be more accepting of people taking initiative in trying to improve things. You must make them feel comfortable and allow others contribute to your domain. Actively seek feedback. Again, do not label people or teams and don’t forget your primary allegiances should be to customer success and to the company.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#boring-solutions" id="boring-solutions">Boring solutions</a></h3>
<p>Use the simplest and most <a href="http://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology">boring solution</a> for a problem, and remember that “boring” should not be conflated with “bad” or “technical debt.” The speed of innovation for our organization and product is constrained by the total complexity we have added so far, so every little reduction in complexity helps. Don’t pick an interesting technology just to make your work more fun; using established, popular tech will ensure a more stable and more familiar experience for you and other contributors.</p>
<p>Make a conscious effort to recognize the constraints of others within the team. For example, sales is hard because you are dependent on another organization, and development is hard because you have to preserve the ability to quickly improve the product in the future.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#efficiency-for-the-right-group" id="efficiency-for-the-right-group">Efficiency for the right group</a></h3>
<p>Optimize solutions globally for the broader MayaData community and specifically for our customers and users. Making a process efficient for one person or a small group may not be the most efficient outcome for the whole community. As an example, it may be best to choose a process making things slightly less efficient for you while making things massively more efficient for thousands of customers. In a decision, ask yourself &quot;for whom does this need to be most efficient?&quot;. Quite often, the answer may be your users, contributors, customers, or team members that are dependent upon your decision. <strong>When in doubt, choose to understand, support, help and delight the customer user.</strong></p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#openness" id="openness">Openness</a></h2>
<p>We build our software in the open.  We collaborate with users in the open.  And we strive to build a radically open culture.</p>
<p>Be open about as many things as possible. By making information public we can reduce the threshold to contribution and make collaboration easier.</p>
<p>Openness creates awareness for MayaData, allows us to reach out to people that care about our culture, it gets us more and faster feedback from people outside the company, and makes it easier to collaborate with them. It is also about sharing great software, documentation, examples, lessons, and processes with the world in the spirit of open source, which we believe creates more value than it captures.</p>
<p>Everyone can <strong>remind</strong> anyone in the company about our values. If there is a disagreement about the interpretations, the discussion can be escalated to more people within the company without repercussions.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#public-by-default" id="public-by-default">Public by default</a></h3>
<p>Everything at MayaData is public by default unless it’s documented otherwise here.  A good practice is to move DMs in chat onto a public channel, perhaps creating a thread to limit impact on that channel.  This way for example anyone can search on a subject and find your conversation, thereby reducing ramp up time and limiting costs of coordination.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#examples-of-not-public-information" id="examples-of-not-public-information">Examples of not public information.</a></h3>
<p>Not public by default are the following items that may impact our users and employees and doesn’t benefit being public:</p>
<ul>
<li>Security vulnerabilities are not public since it would allow attackers to compromise MayaData installations.</li>
<li>Financial information, including revenue and costs for the company.</li>
<li>Deals with external parties like contracts and approving and paying invoices.</li>
<li>Content that would violate confidentiality for a MayaData team-member, customer, or user.</li>
<li>Legal discussions are not public due to the purpose of Attorney-Client Privilege.</li>
<li>Some information is kept confidential by the People Group to protect the privacy, safety, and security of team members and applicants.</li>
<li>Partnerships with other companies are not public since the partners are frequently not comfortable with that.</li>
<li>Acquisition offers for us are not public since informing people of an acquisition that might not happen can be very disruptive.</li>
<li>Acquisition offers we give are not public since the organization being acquired frequently prefers to have them stay private.</li>
<li>Customer information in issues.</li>
<li>Competitive sales and marketing campaign planning is confidential since we want to minimize the time the competition has to respond to it.</li>
<li>When we discuss a customer by name that is not public unless we're sure the customer is OK with that.</li>
<li>Plans for reorganizations are not public and on a need-to-know basis within the organization. Reorganizations cause disruption and the plans tend to change a lot before being finalized, so being public about them prolongs the disruption. We will keep relevant team-members informed whenever possible.</li>
<li>R&amp;D that has not made it to the published road map or the open source POC level is not public.</li>
<li>There is a huge amount that we all know about why users buy, what are the weaknesses of competitors, where Kubernetes and standards like NVMe and similar area headed that are not proprietary and yet also fit into a level of understanding that is uncommon in the broader industry and as such should be treated as valuable and discussed only when needed to help users, customers, partners and other stakeholders</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="header" href="#share-problems" id="share-problems">Share problems</a></h3>
<p>Share problems you run into, ask for help, be forthcoming with information and speak up. For example, consider making private issues public wherever possible so that we can all learn from the experience.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#measure-what-matters-and-publish-it-publicly" id="measure-what-matters-and-publish-it-publicly">Measure what matters and publish it publicly</a></h3>
<p>Agree in writing on measurable goals. Within the company we use public OKRs for that. You don't always get results and this will result in criticism from yourself and/or others. We believe our talents can be developed through hard work, good strategies, and input from others. We try to hire people based on their trajectory, not their pedigree.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#write-things-down" id="write-things-down">Write things down</a></h3>
<p>We document everything: in the handbook, in meeting notes, in issues. We do that because <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-does-The-faintest-pencil-is-better-than-the-sharpest-memory-mean">&quot;the faintest pencil is better than the sharpest memory.&quot;</a> It is far more efficient to read a document at your convenience than to have to ask and explain. Having something in version control also lets everyone contribute suggestions to improve it.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#bias-towards-asynchronous-communication" id="bias-towards-asynchronous-communication">Bias towards asynchronous communication</a></h3>
<p>Take initiative to operate asynchronously whenever possible. This shows care and consideration for those who may not be in the same time zone, are traveling outside of their usual time zone, or are structuring their day around pressing commitments at home or in their community.  In other words, use chat, GitHub or other issue tracker and so forth whenever possible.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#anyone-and-anything-can-be-questioned" id="anyone-and-anything-can-be-questioned">Anyone and anything can be questioned.</a></h3>
<p>Any past decisions and guidelines are open to questioning as long as you act in accordance with them until they are changed.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#disagree-and-commit" id="disagree-and-commit">Disagree and commit.</a></h3>
<p>Everything can be questioned but as long as a decision is in place we expect people to commit to executing it, which is a common principle. Sometimes you will not fully understand a decision.  Feel free to bring it up later as we may need to revisit the decision.  In the meantime, keep going.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#say-why-not-just-what" id="say-why-not-just-what">Say why, not just what</a></h3>
<p>Whenever possible, take the extra time to explain changes in policies or approaches - especially when you are adding additional steps that someone must take before their work has an impact; as an example, additional test and validation changes are inevitable and also should be well explained.  A change with no public explanation can lead to a lot of extra rounds of questioning and can be considered a kind of “communication debt” that must be paid off at some point.  Avoid using terms such as &quot;industry standard&quot; or &quot;best practices&quot; as they are vague, opaque, and don't provide enough context as a reason for a change.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#ownership" id="ownership">Ownership</a></h2>
<p>We want each team member to be a <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1430-hire-managers-of-one">manager of one</a> who doesn't need daily check-ins to achieve their goals.</p>
<p>We expect team members to complete tasks that they pick up or are assigned.  Having a task means you are responsible for anticipating and solving problems. As an owner you are responsible for overcoming challenges and there are no excuses.  Take initiative and proactively inform stakeholders when there is something you might not be able to solve.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#do-it-yourself" id="do-it-yourself">Do it yourself</a></h3>
<p>No need to brainstorm, wait for consensus, or <a href="https://www.inc.com/geoffrey-james/collaboration-is-the-enemy-of-innovation.html">do with two</a> what you can do yourself. If you think it is better than what is there now do it, no need to wait for something polished. A task done today is better than a polished result delayed indefinitely.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#outcome-not-output" id="outcome-not-output">Outcome, not output</a></h3>
<p>We care about what you achieve; the code you shipped, the user you made happy, and the team member you helped. Someone who took the afternoon off shouldn't feel like they did something wrong. You don't have to defend how you spend your day. We trust team members to do the right thing instead of having rigid rules. If you are working too many hours, talk to your manager to discuss solutions.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#be-your-own-boss" id="be-your-own-boss">Be your own boss</a></h3>
<p>You should have clear objectives and the freedom to work on them as you see fit. If a meeting doesn't seem interesting and someone's active participation is not critical to the outcome of the meeting, they can always opt to not attend, or during a video call they can work on other things if they want. Staying in the call may still make sense even if you are working on other tasks, so other peers can ping you and get fast answers when needed. This is particularly useful in multi-purpose meetings where you may be involved for just a few minutes.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#global-optimization" id="global-optimization">Global optimization</a></h3>
<p>This name comes from the quick guide to <a href="https://stripe.com/us/jobs/candidate-info?a=1#culture">Stripe's culture</a>. Our definition of global optimization is that you do what is best for the organization as a whole. Don't optimize for the goals of your immediate team when it negatively impacts the goals of other teams, our customer users, and/or the company. Those goals are also your problem and your job. Keep your immediate team as lean as possible, and help other teams achieve their goals.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#be-respectful-of-others-time" id="be-respectful-of-others-time">Be respectful of others' time</a></h3>
<p>Consider the time investment you are asking others to make with meetings and permission process. Try to avoid meetings, and if one is necessary, try to make attendance optional for as many people as possible. Any meeting should have an agenda linked from the invite, you should document the outcome. Instead of having people ask permission, trust their judgment and offer a consultation process if they have questions.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#spend-company-money-like-its-your-own" id="spend-company-money-like-its-your-own">Spend company money like it's your own</a></h3>
<p>Every dollar we spend will have to be earned back; be as frugal with company money as you are with your own. <a href="http://www.amazon.jobs/principles">Amazon states it best</a>: &quot;Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size or fixed expense.”</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#responsibility-over-rigidity" id="responsibility-over-rigidity">Responsibility over rigidity</a></h3>
<p>When possible we give people the responsibility to make a decision and hold them accountable for that instead of imposing rules and approval processes.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#accept-mistakes" id="accept-mistakes">Accept mistakes</a></h3>
<p>Not every problem should lead to a new process to prevent them. Additional processes make all actions more inefficient, a mistake only affects one.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#an-algorithm-for-distributed-decision-making" id="an-algorithm-for-distributed-decision-making">An algorithm for distributed decision making</a></h3>
<p>Use narratives, check sheets, and other tools  If you are proposing a new approach, sometimes a meeting isn’t enough and neither is a chat discussion.  If you believe MayaData teams or the broader community or others need to align in a certain way to achieve an outcome, please take the time to articulate your reasoning in narrative form.  This approach borrows heavily on the <a href="https://slab.com/blog/jeff-bezos-writing-management-strategy/">narrative structure used by Amazon</a>.</p>
<p>Another technique we embrace is the use of criteria based trade off matrices; this approach starts with outlining the problem and 2-3 alternatives, then turns to listing the criteria by which these alternatives can be judged, and then turns to creating weights for each of these criteria.</p>
<p>The use of Narratives and Trade Off Matricies are important aspects of our internal operating system.  Workshops and onboarding training sessions help to distribute these important algorithms.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#winning" id="winning">Winning</a></h2>
<p>Working at MayaData will expose you to situations of various levels of difficulty and complexity. This requires focus, and the ability to defer gratification. We value the ability to maintain focus and motivation when work is tough and asking for help when needed.</p>
<p>We prefer making results count over perfecting the process. We assume nothing and we keep pushing ourselves until the job is done. We keep our promises and make sure our people keep their promises.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#confidence" id="confidence">Confidence</a></h3>
<p>A winner knows deep down that she or he deserves to win and that confidence itself - no matter what the situation - is crucial to achieve a positive outcome.  There is rarely success without commitment and rarely commitment without confidence.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#see-others-succeed" id="see-others-succeed">See others succeed</a></h3>
<p>We win as a single team and we take pride in contributing towards make each other succeed. If anyone is blocked by you, on a question, your approval, or a merge request review, your top priority is always to unblock them, either directly or through helping them find someone else who can, even if this takes time away from your own or your immediate team's priorities.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#sense-of-urgency" id="sense-of-urgency">Sense of urgency</a></h3>
<p>At an exponentially scaling startup time gained or lost has compounding effects. Try to get the results as fast as possible so the compounding of results can begin and we can focus on the next improvement.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#ambitious-and-always-polishing-yourself" id="ambitious-and-always-polishing-yourself">Ambitious and always polishing yourself</a></h3>
<p>While we iterate with small changes, we strive for large, ambitious results. You keep picking yourself up, dusting yourself off, and quickly get going again having learned a little more.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#bias-for-action" id="bias-for-action">Bias for Action</a></h3>
<p>It's important that we keep our focus on action, and don't fall into the trap of analysis paralysis or sticking to a slow, quiet path without risk. Decisions should be thoughtful, but delivering fast results requires the fearless acceptance of occasionally making mistakes; our bias for action also allows us to course correct quickly.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#accepting-uncertainty" id="accepting-uncertainty">Accepting Uncertainty</a></h3>
<p>The ability to accept that there are things that we don’t know about the work we’re trying to do, and that the best way to drive out that uncertainty is not by layering analysis and conjecture over it, but rather accepting it and moving forward, driving it out as we go along. Wrong solutions can be fixed, but non-existent ones aren’t adjustable at all. <a href="https://www.cleverpm.com/2018/08/23/accepting-uncertainty-is-the-key-to-agility/">The Clever PM Blog</a>.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#move-fast-by-shipping-the-minimum-viable-change" id="move-fast-by-shipping-the-minimum-viable-change">Move fast by shipping the minimum viable change</a></h3>
<p>We value constant improvement by iterating quickly, month after month. If a task is too big to deliver in one month, cut the scope.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#reduce-cycle-time" id="reduce-cycle-time">Reduce Cycle time</a></h3>
<p>We do the <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/2017/01/04/behind-the-scenes-how-we-built-review-apps/">smallest thing possible and get it out as quickly as possible</a>. This value is the one people most misunderstood when they join MayaData. People are trained that if you don't deliver a perfect or polished thing you get dinged for it. If you do just one piece of something you have to come back to it. Doing the whole thing seems more efficient, even though it isn't. If the complete picture is not clear your work might not be perceived as you want it to be perceived. It seems better to make a comprehensive product. They see other people in the MayaData organization being really effective with iteration but don't know how to make the transition, and it's hard to shake the fear that constant iteration can lead to shipping lower-quality work or a worse product.</p>
<p>However, if we take smaller steps and ship smaller simpler features, we get feedback sooner. Instead of spending time working on the wrong feature or going in the wrong direction, we can ship the smallest product, receive fast feedback, and course correct.</p>
<p>The way to resolve this is to write down only what you can do with the time you have for this project right now. That might be 5 minutes or 2 hours. Think of what you can complete in that time that would improve the current situation. Don't write a large plan, only write the first step. Trust that you'll know better how to proceed after something is released. You're doing it right if you're slightly embarrassed by the minimal feature set shipped in the first iteration.</p>
<p>People might ask why something was not perfect. In that case, mention that it was an iteration, you spent only &quot;x&quot; amount of time on it, and that the next iteration will contain &quot;y&quot; and be ready on &quot;z&quot;.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#focus-on-improvement" id="focus-on-improvement">Focus on Improvement</a></h3>
<p>We believe great companies sound negative because they focus on what they can improve, not on what is working. Our first question in every conversation with someone outside the company should be: what do you think we can improve? This doesn't mean we don't recognize our successes, for example see our <strong>Say Thanks</strong> value. We are positive about the future of the company; we are present day pessimists and long term optimists.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#when-we-iterate-slowly" id="when-we-iterate-slowly">When we iterate slowly</a></h3>
<p>In some cases, rapid iteration can get in the way of results. For example when adjusting our marketing messaging (where consistency is key), product categories (where we've set development plans), sales methodologies (where we've trained our teams) and this values page (where we use the values to guide all MayaData team-members). In those instances we add additional review to the approval process, not to prohibit, but to be more deliberate in our iteration. The change process is documented on the page and takes place via merge request approvals.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#reproducibility" id="reproducibility">Reproducibility</a></h3>
<p>Enable everybody involved to come to the same conclusion as you. This not only involves reasoning, but also, for example providing raw data and not just plots; scripts to automate tasks and not just the work they have done; and documenting steps while analyzing a problem. Do your best to make the line of thinking transparent to others even if they may disagree. Increases accountability when making decisions and difficult choices.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#life-is-full-of-learning-opportunities" id="life-is-full-of-learning-opportunities">Life is full of learning opportunities</a></h3>
<p>Every job has work that’s less fun than other parts. Every team has projects that succeed, and projects that fail. One of the key determinants of winning individuals is to embrace what you can learn from failure and what you can learn from the parts of the job that you don’t like. Is there a rote task that needs doing and no one wants to do? Figure out how to automate it, how to make it more efficient, or how to do without it at all. Is something wrong with your project and everything is on fire? What can you learn? It’s only a mistake if you do it twice; otherwise it’s <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/11/how-coca-cola-netflix-and-amazon-learn-from-failure">just something that you learned from</a>.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#pledge" id="pledge">Pledge</a></h1>
<p>At MayaData we write and operate the software and build the communities needed to deliver this fundamentally better approach.</p>
<p>Our values include:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>People first.</strong></em>  People before deadlines.  People before sales figures.  When in doubt, we seek to do what is best for each other and for our users and community members.</li>
<li><em><strong>Listen to learn.</strong></em>  We seek to out-listen our competition.  We understand that anyone can understand most of a problem by researching it and thinking about it - but to delight customers requires really understanding their stated and unstated needs.</li>
<li><em><strong>Openness.</strong></em>  In all things we seek to be open.  We use ChatOps and other systems to “over communicate” internally.  And to the extent possible, we share with the community our issues, plans, and even our concerns.</li>
<li><em><strong>Ownership.</strong></em>  We want each team member to be a manager of one who doesn't need daily check-ins to achieve their goals.</li>
<li><em><strong>Winning.</strong></em>  We win.  We are confident in our abilities as a team to dramatically improve the experience of our users.  We know that a proper focus and unrelenting effort will eventually get us recognized as one of the world’s most useful companies by our users for their use cases.  We know winners never quit, never blink, never back down from any challenge.  And winners laugh a lot too.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note the helpful acronym <em><strong>PLOW.</strong></em></p>
<p>Without clear tactics, rituals and metrics, values can be just nice words.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#tactics" id="tactics">Tactics:</a></h2>
<p>Here are some tactics we use to insure we are living up to our values:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Open source:</strong></em>  we believe that open source is a force for good in the world that is completely consistent with our beliefs in openness and listening.  We support open source projects whether they directly help our products or not.  This means engineering allocates time to be useful contributors to these communities, including crafting useful issues and contributing code when possible.  Similarly, we volunteer time with Linux,Gopher,CNCF and other communities and support them via marketing funds and by providing free access to our open source Cafe whenever possible.  We will all be evaluated in part based on contributions to our own and related communities.</li>
<li><em><strong>Getting to know users and each other:</strong></em>  We seek to understand users and each others as individuals.  This means we take the time to know a little bit about them - where did they go to school, what do they do when they are not working, do they like Go or C better, and so forth.  We document our understanding of users.</li>
<li><em><strong>Listening and openness:</strong></em>  We look for and reward team members that go out of their way to clarify and communicate their actions.  Everything from comments in code to useful commit comments as well as of course communications via Chat and in person with other team members will be considered.  We must keep in mind that we are a global company and need to think about how to include non local teammates in discussions and decisions.</li>
<li><em><strong>Winning:</strong></em> We celebrate new users and new customers, new releases and other achievements.  We respect our competitors however we don't worry about what they are doing.  And we are tenacious, and we share our commitment with each other and with the community and users; for example, if a user has a problem we tell them &quot;this will get fixed.  Quickly.  Please open your PR and we will turn around a response for you.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#rituals" id="rituals">Rituals</a></h2>

<h3><a class="header" href="#all-hands-meetings" id="all-hands-meetings">All hands meetings:</a></h3>
<p>We will have at least monthly all hands meetings in which we celebrate successes, get to know each other better, and talk about our progress towards our objectives.  At least one success per meeting should be about an end user.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#weekly-stand-ups" id="weekly-stand-ups">Weekly stand-ups:</a></h3>
<p>We will continue to have weekly team meetings that include opportunities for recognition and discussion of blockers and next steps.  Again, in each meeting we should discuss end user experiences and come up with ideas to enhance it.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#daily-stand-ups" id="daily-stand-ups">Daily stand-ups:</a></h3>
<p>We will continue to have daily standup meetings within in smaller teams to surface blockers and seek help to mitigate them. Our goal with the daily stand-ups is to make sure we meet our immediate milestone commitments. </p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#one-on-ones" id="one-on-ones">One on ones:</a></h3>
<p>Managers should have one on ones with their team members monthly if not more frequently.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#household-manners" id="household-manners">Household manners</a></h3>
<p>We will follow good household manners in our interactions with peer across the globe. Our <a href="./process/etiquettes.html">etiquettes manual</a> covers some suggestions that are considered good household manners.</p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#job-abandonment" id="job-abandonment">Job Abandonment</a></h1>
<p>When a team member is absent from work for two consecutive workdays, there is no entry on the availability calendar for time off, and fails to contact his or her supervisor, they can be terminated for job abandonment unless otherwise required by law.</p>
<p>If a manager is unable to reach an employee via email or slack within a 24 hour period they should contact their HR Business Partner. The HR Business partner will access the employee's information to obtain additional contact methods and numbers. The manager and HR Business Partner will create an action plan to make all attempts to contact the employee.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#paid-time-off" id="paid-time-off">Paid Time Off</a></h1>
<p>Paid Time Off (PTO) policy is applicable to all direct employees of the company. PTO is not applicable for Contractors, Trainees or Interns at the organization.</p>
<p>Employees would be eligible for a fixed number of PTO days per calendar year (January to December). The exact number of PTO days can vary depending on the local laws of the location of the Employee. For instance, Employees from India are entitled to <strong>15 PTO days in every calendar year (January to December)</strong>, and are credited with <strong>1.25 PTO days</strong> at the completion of every month from the date of joining.</p>
<p>Employee can avail PTO days as many times as required  during the calendar year (January to December) or from the date of joining provided:</p>
<ul>
<li>Employee has PTO days available. </li>
<li>Employee has prior approval from the reporting manager, when availing more than 4 days of consecutive PTO days. A manager has the discretion to not approve a leave based on performance issues or critical deadlines.</li>
<li>Employee has informed the reporting manager about the intent to avail PTO days, prior to or on the day of availing the PTO Day. </li>
<li>Employee is expected to keep their team and reporting manager informed about their PTO plan in advance to ensure that someone else can manage important tasks while they are away.</li>
<li>Employee is expected to report their availed PTO days using the tools setup by the HR/Payroll department. Any voilation in reporting can result in a corrective action. Here are some ways to communicate the PTO days: 
<ul>
<li>Send out an note in the #announcement channel - tagging your reporting manager and your local HR manager. </li>
<li>Set the Status of your Slack with the duration of your PTO days.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When availing unplanned PTO, the employee is required to communicate their absence of work within 24 hours to their manager. </p>
<p>If an Employee has not sent notification of absence / or has not reported to work for 72 hours, it will be considered as Job abandonment and corrective action will be taken against the Employee, possibly leading to termination of services. Check the <a href="policy/./job-abandonment.html">Job Abondonment Policy</a>. </p>
<p>If an employee needs to be away from work for longer than the available PTO days, then Loss of Pay Leave policy will be applied for the exceeded days. The PTO days cannot be set off against or combined with any other kind of leave - like sick days off. </p>
<p>If an employee needs to take paid leave during popular holidays, they are required to apply for leave at least 2 months prior to the leave dates. They are requested to keep their manager and  team members informed before availing the approved leave.  This is to ensure that our business operations are not affected during the popular holidays when there is a possibility of more team members taking off.</p>
<p>Unused PTO days in the current calendar year will be carried forward to next year. A maximum of 45 unused PTO days can be accumulated over the years of service at MayaData. The unused PTO (up to a maximum of 45) days will be encashed only at the time of resignation or retirement.</p>
<p>Unused PTO days cannot be offset against the notice period required to be given as part of the terms of employment while the employee is offboarding their services from the company.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#developer-advocacy" id="developer-advocacy">Developer Advocacy</a></h1>
<h2><a class="header" href="#goal" id="goal">Goal</a></h2>
<p>To build MayaData technical brand with deep, meaningful conversations on engineering topics relevant to our industry by <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120625174339/http://meghangill.com:80/2012/06/11/why-invest-in-communit-leaders/">leveraging our community</a> of team-members and the wider ecosystem.</p>
<ul>
<li>The ideal ratio of MayaData team-members to the wider community members should be 20:80. Currently we are more like 95:5. Our challenge is to solve for this while ensuring our presence in key industry events and online forums.</li>
<li>Increase the adoption of MayaData products and influence the product development suited towards SRE and DevOps personas. </li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#why-push-the-wider-community" id="why-push-the-wider-community">Why push the wider community?</a></h2>
<p>Meghan Gill, former developer marketing leader at MongoDB and current VP of Sales Ops there, is a champion of leveraging the community. The reasons she gives are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The psychological reason: Messages about a product are always more powerful coming from a user.</li>
<li>The economic reason: By investing in a community member and helping them become a great evangelist, we spend once and continually reap benefits. However, when we send team-members to conferences, we take time away from their daily jobs slowing down product development. Each time a team member leaves their desk, there is an opportunity cost which we do not have to pay with a community member.</li>
<li>The sustainability reason: Once we enable community members to have a voice in the ecosystem, there is a snowball effect and they get invited to present their point of view repeatedly. Our investment is largely done but the benefit keeps coming back.</li>
<li>The amplification reason: There is no way one company can reach everyone. However, with community evangelists in place, they can amplify the reach beyond a company’s corridors of influence.</li>
</ul>

<h1><a class="header" href="#mayadata-opensource-marketing" id="mayadata-opensource-marketing">MayaData OpenSource Marketing</a></h1>
<p>At MayaData we believe that the best way to deliver storage and related services to containerized and cloud-native environments is with containerized and cloud-native architectures.  Everything we do is focused on providing data agility and simplifying the daily operation of Kubernetes and Platform SRE’s and DevOps teams using Kubernetes as a data layer.  We enable our users to handle complex data management operations easily, and we have become open source leaders in building Kubernetes into a first-class data platform.</p>
<p>In line with our PLOW values, we believe in Open Source Marketing as opposed to traditional marketing. </p>
<p>One of our primary objectives as an open source marketer is to amplify the success of users of the open source solution and to encourage the community to view itself with pride.  Because the open source community is arguably the most important thing that an open source company builds, the role of an open source marketer is critically important. </p>
<p>Here are some guidelines on what we think are the driving principles of a good Open Source Marketer The following owes a lot to the ever famous and far superior memo by Ben Horowitz about what makes a <a href="https://a16z.com/2012/06/15/good-product-managerbad-product-manager/">good product manager</a>:</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#opensource-is-the-way-to-go" id="opensource-is-the-way-to-go">OpenSource is the way to go</a></h2>
<p>A good open source marketer will eschew cliches and ideologies and will show how the community helps to nurture qualified leads and hence customers and partners and employees and investors and other stakeholders like the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. A traditional  marketer will eschew metrics, and spout platitudes such as “there is no such thing as an open-source business model.”</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#be-where-the-users-are" id="be-where-the-users-are">Be where the users are</a></h2>
<p>A good open source marketer finds users wherever they are and listens to them and asks them their opinion.  For instance, a good open source marketer will follow Twitter users that talk about their domain on twitter and will try to form a relationship with them. A traditional marketer thinks social media is just a way to push content to more people.  A traditional marketer assumes that users with personal email addresses are just noise and not worth listening to.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#support-open-source-communities" id="support-open-source-communities">Support Open Source communities</a></h2>
<p>A good open source marketer believes in investing in the open source karma of their community by supporting meet-ups and related projects however they can. A traditional  marketer prefers to spend money on advertising or “lead generation.”</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#anonymous-community-growth-is-important" id="anonymous-community-growth-is-important">Anonymous community growth is important</a></h2>
<p>A good open source marketer will take ownership of the success of the community as measured by usage statistics such as container pulls and also by contributions by the community in the form of blogs and tweets and also pull requests and other more technical contributions. A traditional marketer would only focus on increasing registrations via user contact information. A good open source marketer has the analytics needed to prove to everyone that the community is growing - and is able to direct the efforts of the community and the company to improve those areas in need of improvement.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#all-user-feedback-is-valuable" id="all-user-feedback-is-valuable">All user feedback is valuable</a></h2>
<p>A good open source marketer views even less than 100% positive communication with pride since it shows concern about the future of the project and this type of engagement is important for the growth of the community. A traditional marketer will try to hide any opinions that are not 100% positive about the open source project. </p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#focus-on-what-users-need" id="focus-on-what-users-need">Focus on what users need</a></h2>
<p>A good open source marketer helps engineering to remain focused on what users really need as opposed to what engineering thinks they should need.  A traditional marketer complains about engineering, about the users, about competitors, and about the open source itself.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#help-users-advance-their-knowledge" id="help-users-advance-their-knowledge">Help users advance their knowledge</a></h2>
<p>Good open source marketers help users to understand and adapt to the changing technological landscape. For instance, when it comes to measuring storage performance, help users understand what are the new variables and how to evaluate and set up storage benchmarking. Traditional marketers are led around by users that do not yet understand how to evaluate container attached storage and go with their assessment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Objectives and key results are the yin and yang of goal setting.” from John Doerr’s Measure What Matters</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At MayaData we believe in <a href="https://github.com/mayadata-io/culture/blob/master/plow.md">PLOW culture</a> where everyone is committed and accountable to working as a team to deliver company objectives. OKRs provide the best mechanism to gain visibility into everyone’s objectives. OKRs expose redundant efforts and save time and money.</p>
<p>OKRs lay out our plan to execute our strategy and help make sure we achieve them with clearly defined goals throughout the organization. </p>
<p>OKRs help in providing clarity and alignment in terms of what needs to be accomplished by an individual. </p>
<p>OKRs are also a great tool for individuals to stay focused on what they have agreed to accomplish for the company. </p>
<p>OKRs provide both top-down and bottom-up alignment.</p>
<p>OKRs allows managers and individuals to step away from the need for Micromanagement - which is more a sign of mismanagement or an ineffective team composition. </p>
<p>OKRs is a key enabler for our culture that helps each individual to realize their personal dreams and aspirations, while staying committed to helping MayaData customers succeed in their jobs.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#okrs" id="okrs">OKRs</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR">OKRs</a> stand for Objective- Key Results and are our quarterly objectives.</p>
<p>OKRs are of the following format:</p>
<pre><code>   OBJECTIVE as a sentence.
   KEY RESULTS: 
   * Key result that is measurable 
   * Key result that is measurable 
   * Key result that is measurable 
</code></pre>
<p>You can use the phrase “I will achieve a certain OBJECTIVE as measured by the following KEY RESULTS…” to know if your OKR makes sense.</p>
<p>OKRs must be defined for each Quarter with a maximum of four objectives. An individual’s OKRs must a mix of: </p>
<ul>
<li>3 Primary role objectives  and</li>
<li>1 Personal career aspiration objective. </li>
</ul>
<p>Each objective has between 1 and 4 key results; if you have less, you list less.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://medium.com/startup-tools/okrs-5afdc298bc28">Startup OKR template</a> provides a good explanation on how to go about writing the OKRs. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Objectives:</strong></p>
<p>The goal of setting&gt;  an Objective is to write out what you hope to accomplish such that at a later time you can easily tell if you have reached, or have a clear path to reaching that objective.</p>
<p>Choosing the right objectives is one of the hardest things to do and requires a great deal of thinking and courage to do well.</p>
<p><strong>Key Results:</strong></p>
<p>Assuming your Objectives are well thought through, Key Results are the secret sauce to using OKRs. Key Results are numerically-based expressions of success or progress towards an Objective.</p>
<p>The important element here is measuring success. It’s not good enough to make broad statements about improvement (that are subjectively evaluated). We need to know how well you are succeeding. Qualitative goals tend to under-represent our capabilities because the solution tends to be the lowest common denominator.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p>Consider an objective called <code>launch new training for the sales team</code>. This can be accomplished by an individual by putting out a training material out there or by testing the material with a single sales member. However a good key result would be one that can be easily measured and is a stretch - like <code>train 50 sales team members</code>. It is possible that the individual can end-up training only 10, but it is better than just publishing or training a single person. The performance of the individual jumped 10-ex with properly articulating the key result.</p>
<pre><code>OBJECTIVE: launch new training for the sales team
KEY RESULTS:
* publish new training material on company portal
* train 50 sales team members
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>OKRs are meant to be ambitious and hard to achieve. Usually, it isn’t expected that anyone hits 100% of an OKR. Expected performance is generally:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you hit 70% of the Key Result, it's considered a positive. </li>
<li>If you hit 110% of the key result, that's a likely sign that the individual and manager who oversaw the OKR didn't manage it well and set the goal too low. </li>
<li>If you get 50% or less, it's possible that
<ul>
<li>Priorities changed</li>
<li>The employee did a poor job working on the objective</li>
<li>The Key Result was set poorly (too high).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It takes 2 - 4 quarters to get skilled at setting OKRs; your first few times setting goals you will likely be all over the place in terms of OKR completion at the end of a quarter. That’s normal. As you get better, you should be able to scope out the quarter’s work and performance with more confidence.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#okr-setting-process" id="okr-setting-process">OKR Setting Process</a></h2>
<p>OKR setting is highly collaborative process and takes time and discipline to get it right. OKRs are widely shared and meant to be understood by teams and individuals. Each individual must have their OKRs reviewed by their <a href="process/okr.html#technical-leads">Technical Lead</a>, <a href="process/okr.html#people-managers">People Manager</a>, Peers and/or their <a href="process/okr.html#mentors">mentor</a>. </p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#okr-cycle" id="okr-cycle">OKR cycle</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>By the 1st of the quarter, CEO (Company) and Executives (department) OKRs are published. This process typically starts off towards the last month of the previous quarter where CEO and executives meet to plan for the next quarter and align their OKRs. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By the 15th of the first month in a quarter the OKRs are reviewed and published along with the all-hands. This process involves:</p>
<ul>
<li>Technical or Team Leads publishing their OKRs that are aligned with the CEO/Executive OKRs</li>
<li>Individuals share their OKRs in alignment  with their Team / Technical Lead OKRs and it is also possible that some of the objectives may be directly aligned towards CEO/Executives. As we taken on cross functional or multiple roles as required by the Startup culture. </li>
<li>Individual and Team OKRs are reviewed and updated. The feedback from the Individual OKRs conducted as a team will translate into updating the Team/Technical Lead, Individual or eventually the Executive OKRs.</li>
<li>For the personal objectives, the Individual should seek help from People Manager or mentors for review. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>By the 15th of the second month a mid-review score is updated by the individuals </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By the 30th of the third month the final reviews are completed and work on the next Quarters reviews are started. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#technical-leads" id="technical-leads">Technical Leads</a></h2>
<p>Technical Leads are responsible for a product or a complete feature. Technical Leads have to work with many other individual contributors to accomplish a larger goal.</p>
<p>When the goals set through OKRs are not being accomplished due to any number of reasons including under performing individuals to complex features, the TL can redistribute the tasks to accomplish the goal. </p>
<p>Technical leads are responsible for accomplishing the product/company goal and not responsible for evenly distributing tasks to employees or worrying about the career growth. Individuals have to take ownership for their goals and career growth and seek help from mentors or people managers.</p>

<p>People Managers are responsible for helping individuals bring and deliver their best to MayaData. People Manager abide by <a href="https://github.com/mayadata-io/culture">PLOW / culture handbook</a>. </p>
<p>Individuals need to work out with the People managers for their career growth objectives and have them self aligned with the roles and responsibilities outlined in the <a href="https://github.com/mayadata-io/culture">culture handbook</a>. </p>
<p>People Managers are required to update the <a href="https://github.com/mayadata-io/culture">PLOW/culture handbook</a> when responding to the queries that are common to all the individuals. For instance, <a href="https://github.com/mayadata-io/culture">PLOW / culture handbook</a> should be referred when answering anything related and not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Questions on Leave Management via Tools and Policy </li>
<li>Event Sponsorships via Developer Advocacy Handbook</li>
<li>Career Growth via Roles and Responsibilities</li>
</ul>
<p>People Managers can be reached out to queries or concerns related to Salary and Benefits, which can then be answered via updates to the PLOW policy or through contacting the HR. </p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#types-of-meetings-with-people-managers" id="types-of-meetings-with-people-managers">Types of Meetings with People Managers</a></h3>
<p>The outcome of each of these meetings is captured in a document and is confidential between the individual and the people manager. Some outcomes discussed in the meeting that are useful for others in the organization like updating the PLOW can be shared to every-one. </p>
<ul>
<li>1:1 Performance Review Meetings scheduled at least monthly and increasing the frequency depending on the individual’s needs. </li>

</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#mentors" id="mentors">Mentors</a></h2>
<p>Mentors are experts or have experience in a given area/topic and others in the organization can seek the help from Mentors to learn or gain experience in that area/topic. </p>
<p>Anyone can be mentors. Mentors can be senior or junior in experience than the mentee. </p>
<p>Mentor:mentee sessions are completely optional and if taken, must be taken seriously. The PLOW values of committing and respecting also apply to Mentor:mentee meetings. Schedule and prepare for the meetings with a clear agenda. Once the goals are met, discuss and either reduce the frequency or end the sessions. Make room for other learning experiences. </p>
<p>Mentor discussions should not be confused with better performance reviews or salary discussions, that must be had with <a href="process/okr.html#people-managers">People Managers</a>. </p>
<p>Mentor sessions are inherently meant to be only individual centric, positive and objective to foster learning.

<h1><a class="header" href="#paid-time-off-1" id="paid-time-off-1">Paid Time Off</a></h1>
<p>This page is written with a focus on vacation/leave policies taken towards <a href="https://github.com/mayadata-io/culture/blob/master/policy/paid-time-off.md">Paid Time Off</a>.</p>
<p>MayaData allows for 15 days of Personal Time Off or Vacation Days or Paid Time Off days that are in addition to:</p>
<ul>
<li>National Holidays governed by your location</li>
<li>Leaves taken for medical needs, whether physical or mental</li>
<li>Leaves taken towards major life changing events like becoming a parent, losing a family member</li>
<li>Leaves taken to fulfill your duties as a citizen to your nation like Voting Leave or Jury Duty leave and so forth. </li>
</ul>
<p>MayaData recognizes that it is very important to take time off to recharge batteries and refresh the mind so you can come back to your work and commitments with renewed energy and be prepared to do your best work ever! MayaData also encourages you to use your leave for medical needs, jury duty, bereavement leave, or to vote. You are not expected to work during this time off, but we recommend following the guidance under Communicating Your Time Off when these situations arise.</p>
<p>Time away from work can be extremely helpful for maintaining a good work/life balance. MayaData encourages managers and leadership to set the example by taking time off when needed, and ensuring their reports do the same.</p>
<p>PTO do not have to be trips to exotic places, but instead could be taking some time for oneself at home. A great example for a personal time off is to take care of long outstanding chores at home, or to provide medical care to a family member or a friend.</p>
<p>Working hours are flexible. You don't need to worry about taking time off to go to the gym, take a nap, go grocery shopping, do household chores, help someone, take care of a loved one, etc. If you have urgent tasks, but something comes up or takes longer than expected, just ensure the rest of the team knows and someone can pick up the tasks (assuming you're able to communicate). When your personal work keeps your away from work and are unable to put in the required hours to complete your tasks per day, we trust that you will use your time off and communicate it to your manager and team.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#guide-to-use-paid-time-off" id="guide-to-use-paid-time-off">Guide to use Paid Time Off</a></h2>
<p>As we all work remotely it can sometimes be difficult to know when and how to plan time off. Here is some advice and guidance on how this can be done in an easy and collaborative way.</p>
<ul>
<li>We have a &quot;no ask, must tell&quot; time off policy. This means that:
<ul>
<li>You do not need to ask permission to take time off unless you want to have more than 4 calendar days off in a release cycle that runs from 15th to 15th of every month. The 4 day limit is to ensure that business continuity is maintained. </li>
<li>What we care about are your results, not how long you work. While you don't need to ask approval for time off, it shouldn’t be at the expense of business getting done. Please coordinate with your team before taking time off, especially during popular or official holidays, so that we can ensure business continuity. We want to ensure we have adequate coverage and avoid situations where all/most of the team is taking time off at the same time.</li>
<li>When taking time off make sure your manager is aware of your absence. Informing your manager can be done by sending a shout out in the #announcements slack and also including your local HR contact. Giving your manager and team members a heads up early helps them prioritize work and meet business goals and deadlines.</li>
<li>If you're gone for 48 hours without prior notification, this could be deemed as a case of <a href="https://github.com/mayadata-io/culture/blob/master/policy/job-abandonment.md">Job Abandonment</a>.</li>
<li>It can be helpful to take longer breaks to re-energize. If this is helpful to you, we strongly recommend taking at least two consecutive weeks of time off per year.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We don't frown on people taking time off, but rather encourage people to take care of themselves and others by having some time away. If you notice that your co-worker is working long hours over a sustained period, you may want to let them know about the time off policy.</li>
<li>Not taking vacation is viewed as a weakness and people shouldn't boast about it. It is viewed as a lack of humility about your role, not fostering collaboration in training others in your job, and not being able to document and explain your work. You are doing the company a disservice by being a single point of failure. The company must be able to go for long periods without you. We don't want to lose you permanently by you burning yourself out by not taking regular vacations.</li>
<li>You are invited to the company call and your team calls if you are available, but it isn't mandatory and you shouldn't attend if it is during your time off. We encourage you to read the call agenda on your return to catch up on the announcements made while you were on your time off.</li>
<li>Please also remember to turn on your out of office message and include the contact details of a co-worker in case anything urgent or critical comes into your inbox while you're away. If you have to respond to an incident while on-call outside of your regular working hours, you should feel free to take off some time the following day to recover and be well-rested. If you feel pressured to not take time off to rest, refer to this part of the handbook and explain that you had to handle an incident.</li>
<li>When returning from paid time off, it can be helpful to schedule a coffee chat or two on the day of your return to get caught up, share stories from your time off, and simply reconnect with your team members. It also provides a nice break from to-dos and unread emails. This type of conversation may occur organically in a colocated office but needs to be managed with intent in an all-remote company.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#communicating-your-time-off" id="communicating-your-time-off">Communicating Your Time Off</a></h2>
<p>Communicate broadly when you will be away so other people can manage time efficiently, projects don't slip through the cracks, and so that you don't get bothered while away.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you plan to be out of the office for more than 48 hours, update your Slack status with your out of office dates by clicking on your profile picture and selecting &quot;Edit Status.&quot; For Example: 'OOO Back on 2020-02-20.' Don't forget to change it back upon your return, and be aware that this information is publicly accessible.</li>
<li>Add an out of office automated response including the dates you plan to be away in your automated response.</li>
<li>Decline any meetings you will not be present for so the organizer can make appropriate arrangements.</li>
<li>If your team or work group has a specific scheduling calendar, ensure to update it with your out of office plans. Bring it up in your team standups</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#communicating-time-off-for-an-emergency-situations" id="communicating-time-off-for-an-emergency-situations">Communicating Time Off for an Emergency Situations</a></h2>
<p>Emergencies, by definition are unexpected. They can range from natural disasters, terrorist events, accidents, family deaths, hospitalization and any other unexpected situation. During these times we ask team members to use their best judgement as well as listen to and adhere to public safety officials when possible. If an unexpected emergency occurs please contact your manager via slack or email or phone as soon as possible if you will be unavailable or unable to work. This will allow your manager to confirm your safety and reassign any critical work during your absence. If you do not have an emergency contact provided to your HR please go ahead and complete that section. We will only contact that person if we are unable to reach you via slack, email or phone.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#recognizing-burnout" id="recognizing-burnout">Recognizing Burnout</a></h2>
<p>It is important for us to take a step back to recognize and acknowledge the feeling of being &quot;burned out&quot;. We are not as effective or efficient when we work long hours, miss meals or forego nurturing our personal lives for sustained periods of time. If you feel that you or someone on your team may be experiencing <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/burnout/art-20046642">burnout</a>, be sure to address it right away.</p>
<p>To get ahead of a problem, be sure to communicate with your manager if any of the following statements ever apply to you:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;I am losing interest in social interaction.&quot; - This is especially dangerous in an all-remote setting.</li>
<li>&quot;I've lost the motivation to work.&quot; - Everyone has days when they don't want to work but if you hear yourself saying this often, you're on the road to burnout.</li>
<li>&quot;I often feel tired.&quot; - Indicative of being overworked for prolonged periods of time.</li>
<li>&quot;I get agitated easily.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;I've been hostile to my coworkers.&quot; - You see yourself &quot;snap&quot; at people for no apparent reason.</li>
<li>&quot;I've been having headaches often.&quot; - A headache can manifest itself for multiple reasons but if you catch yourself only having headaches on work days, it is time to evaluate your situation.</li>
</ul>
<p>If someone is showing signs of burnout, they should take time off to focus on things that are relaxing and improve their overall health and welfare.</p>
<p>Other tips to avoid burnout include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assess and pursue your interests, skills and passions.</li>
<li>Take breaks during the day to eat healthy food and stretch your legs. The Timeout app can help with that.</li>
<li>Make time each day to increase blood and oxygen circulation which improves brain activity and functionality.</li>
<li>Get plenty of restful sleep.</li>
<li>Meditate to take your mind away from work. Headspace and Calm are good tools for creating meditation habits.</li>
<li>Don't start work as soon as you wake up. Take your time doing your morning routine.</li>
<li>Set yourself as away when you are not working. Snooze your Slack notifications. It is fine to be not reachable during your off time.</li>
<li>Don't let burnout creep up on you. Working remotely can allow us to create bad habits, such as working straight through lunch to get something finished. Once in a while this feels good, perhaps to check that nagging task or big project off the list, but don't let this become a bad habit. Before long, you'll begin to feel the effects on your body and see it in your work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind that you are not alone! Chances are that you have a colleague who already experienced burnout or has been on the road to burnout. Schedule coffee calls with your team members or with anyone you'd like to talk to. Talk to your manager. If none of that is an option for you, schedule a call with your HR Manager.</p>
<p>Take care not to burn yourself out</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#managements-role-in-paid-time-off" id="managements-role-in-paid-time-off">Management’s Role in Paid Time Off</a></h2>
<p>Managers have a duty of care towards their direct reports in managing their wellbeing and ensuring that time off is being taken. Sometimes, when working remotely from home, a good work-life balance can be difficult to find. It is also easy to forget that your team is working across multiple time zones, so some may feel obligated to work longer to ensure there is overlap. It is important that you check-in with your reports through one-to-ones, and if you think someone needs some time off let them know they can do this.</p>
<p>If you discover that multiple people in your team want to be off at the same time, see what the priorities are, review the impact to the business, and use your best judgement. Discuss this with your team so you can manage the time off together. It is also a good idea to remind your team to give everyone an early heads-up, if possible, about upcoming vacation plans.</p>
<p>As a manager, it is your task to evaluate your team's state of mind. Address possible burnout by discussing options with your team member to manage contributing stressors and evaluate the workload. Some things to help with this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Try to follow each of your team members' work habits. If they start being less efficient, or working more hours, they might be on the road to burnout.</li>
<li>Try to keep track of when they had their last paid day off. If they hadn't had a personal day in a long time, look closer at their behaviour.</li>
<li>Make sure you let your team members know they can talk to you about their challenges.</li>
<li>When you recognize symptoms of burnout in others, help them to get out the &quot;Burnout trap&quot;. Don't just tell people to take a break, but help them arrange things so they can take a break. Ask why they feel they can't take a break (there are almost certainly real, concrete reasons) and then ask permission to get busy putting things in place that will overcome those barriers. People might be trapped by their own fatigue, being too worn out to find the creative solutions needed to take a break.</li>

<p>OpenEBS releases can be either Major (like 1.1 or 1.2) and Minor (like 1.2.1). Major releases contain features and pre-planned bug fixes. Minor releases contain emergency fixes that community users or customers are waiting for. Both these releases do not have a fixed calendar day for a release but they get released in asap model. Minor releases are delivered within a sprint. Major releases are planned into the sprints and can across multiple sprints.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#openebs-director-releases" id="openebs-director-releases">OpenEBS Director releases</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The goal is to make a OpenEBS Director release everyday.</li>
</ul>
<p>###OpenEBS Director Release process</p>
<p>Key stakeholders:
Product Management - Ajesh
Development - Vishnu Attur
Product Quality - Giridhar Prasad</p>
<p>Release schedule:</p>
<p>Once in a day (Weekdays). 5PM IST
Go/Nogo meeting((over the slack) : 4PM IST </p>
<p>Every component/module  would be packaged as a  helm chart  versioned in the format <module>-&lt;major_version_#&gt;-&lt;minor_version_#&gt;-&lt;release_version_#&gt;-&lt;commit_sha&gt;*</p>
<p>Every branch runs through the various stages in our CI/CD pipeline :
Stage 1: Clone the source repo for the branch to be built
Stage 2: Build the code and package it as a docker image
Stage 3: Run the unit test suite, gather test coverage and publish it
Stage 3: Run the static analysis of vulnerabilities in application containers
Stage 4: Push the docker image to docker hub
Stage 5: Create a helm chart for the module and publish it.
Stage 6: Deploy the helm chart and send a notification to the #production in slack.
Stage 7: Run the integration test for the entire application and publish the report.</p>
<p>The staging branch of every module gets deployed to staging namespace.
Similarly, the master branch gets deployed to production cluster(namespace)</p>
<p>For deployments to the production environment, we follow a release process to make sure we release the stable artifacts. Deployments to master require a PR to be raised from staging to master that results in a PR-merge branch(this happens in Jenkins and needs to be tested) that needs to go through all the 7 stages described above in a pre-prod cluster(namespace). This PR may consist of “n” number of PRs merged into the staging from their respective feature/bugfix branches and needs to be reviewed and approved by module lead, SRE(to make), QA and the management(product manager, etc.,)</p>
<p>Responsibilities of various teams during a production deployment include but is not limited to :</p>
<p>Module lead:
Capture the unit test cases added for this release
PRs with an appropriate description that has been merged into staging. Squash commits generally carry all relevant data. Also, make sure that the PR had been assigned a zenhub issue.
Inform the SRE team on whether it was a major/minor release as mentioned up. SRE can then bump up the helm versions accordingly.</p>
<p>SRE 
Create a new release branch conforming to the nomenclature and annotated tags.
Work with the developers to raise a pull request against the master and run the CI suite.
Makes sure only approved features and bug fixes make it to production.
Checklist has been duly followed by the module leads.
Any special provisions needed for deployment?  Gather the information from the module leads and draft it in DR/notes.
Release notes are available for publishing to the customer.
Disaster recovery plan has been drafted and the on-call group has been constituted to monitor and take any actions on MO if needed.
Vote as GO/NOGO for the release to be deployed and let the team know as to why they think so. </p>
<p>QA 
Make sure that automation QA suite has run against the latest build in pre-prod
Dedicate a QA team member for post deployment quick sanity checks and let the stakeholders know.
Vote/Veto for the release to be deployed on the production supporting it with their arguments in favor or against it,
Perform a load testing on the cluster and present the report to the team</p>
<p>All the discussion pertaining to the production deployment happens in the #production channel. Our goal is to automate our recordings and actions via slack being our primary chatops tool for deployment and publishing reports. Initially, we may be running a few manual steps but once such action items are identified, SRE will add them as an action item for their forthcoming sprints.</p>
<p>Disaster recovery and rollbacks:
Ours would be an immutable infrastructure i.e., we would deploy only a blessed image to the production i.e., no changes to the server or our deployments via manual </p>
<p>A blessed release is one that was built when the staging branch is merged into master, runs all basic sanity checks, demonstrates a confident test coverage in CI and has been approved by all stakeholders - module lead, QA and SRE. There could be cases of dependent deployments wherein one module would be dependent on the other and also the chronological order of deployment may be of significance. We do not make the incremental changes to the infrastructure but instead, a new one would be spawned and the previous image is still available for a rollback of the environment itself to a good known state. </p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#remote-first" id="remote-first">Remote First</a></h1>
<p>MayaData is a remote first company with team members working in different  time zones and located in half-dozen countries or more. MayaData’s remote-first culture allows you to choose when and where you live and work, your work can revolve around your life as opposed to the other way around. Remote first fits perfectly with our PLOW culture of <a href="https://github.com/mayadata-io/culture/blob/master/plow.md#people-first">people first</a> and (openness)[https://github.com/mayadata-io/culture/blob/master/plow.md#openness].</p>
<p>Working remotely and running a remote team may seem like an outrageous idea to many, who have worked in organizations that allow their employees to occasionally work from home in case of emergencies. In our experience of running a company without a traditional head-quarters we have learnt to be more open and effective, combined with working with Open Source and Kubernetes community, the boundaries of a physical location made no sense. Thankfully we have also had a lot to learn from other companies that are successfully running an All-remote organizations like <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/">GitLab</a>.</p>
<p>We strongly believe that remote-first and all remote organizations tend to attract people who place a high degree of value on <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2018/10/18/the-case-for-all-remote-companies/">autonomy</a>, <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2019/06/25/how-remote-work-at-gitlab-enables-location-independence/">flexibility</a>, <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2019/07/09/tips-for-working-from-home-remote-work/">empathy</a>, and <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/inclusion/#fully-distributed-and-completely-connected">mobility</a>.</p>
<p>While we are striving towards moving to an All-remote organization, with more than 30% of the employees already operating in all-remote, we are also committed to retain few physical offices in locations with a large concentration of Employees. We realize that such a model brings about <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/hybrid-remote/#are-there-advantages-to-hybrid-remote">advantages and challenges</a> in terms of ensuring that the employees working in the office operate in a remote friendly way.</p>
<p><em>Remote-first means working remote is the default. It means making sure your remote employees are as much a part of the team as those in the office.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/02/08/means-remote-first-company/">Remote-first</a> means when somebody wants to present something, they’re not going to stand up at a whiteboard and write while the remotes squint at their screens trying to see it. We present electronically. It means when somebody refers to a document, they send a link to the whole group. These seem like small things. But they’re not. When you treat the coworker two desks down the same, for the most part, as you do your coworker in London, everyone has a great feeling of belonging and engagement. That leads to greater happiness and productivity for everyone.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#remote-first-manifesto" id="remote-first-manifesto">Remote First Manifesto</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Flexible working hours over set working hours.</li>
<li>Writing down and recording knowledge over verbal explanations.</li>
<li>Written down processes over on-the-job training.</li>
<li>Public sharing of information over need-to-know access.</li>
<li>Opening up every document for editing by anyone over top-down control of documents.</li>
<li>Asynchronous communication over synchronous communication.</li>
<li>The results of work over the hours put in.</li>
<li>Formal communication channels over informal communication channels.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#remote-employee-evaluation" id="remote-employee-evaluation">Remote Employee Evaluation</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>People First.</strong> Trust that everyone is working in alignment with <a href="https://github.com/mayadata-io/culture/blob/master/plow.md">PLOW values</a> and are thinking globally rather than themselves or their teams.  This means that:
<ul>
<li>Employees need to trust that their managers are looking out for their best interest. </li>
<li>Managers need to trust that their employees are engaged and motivated at work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Part of this trust is built during the hiring process—selecting candidates who are self-motivated—and the rest is built over time with each positive interaction. Just like in-person office cultures, remote office cultures can differ wildly.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The Team Wins Together.</strong> We all win together. Success in this company is not a zero sum game. Did someone else deliver a big victory in your team? Excellent. Celebrate it, congratulate them, and learn from what they did so you can drive yourself to your next big win.</p>
<p>Don't tear down or minimize the victories of other people in this company. Positivity adds momentum; negativity adds drag.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Continuous Checkin and Feedback.</strong> If employees are more familiar working in an office environment where they receive feedback daily, the silence in a remote position can be the perfect breeding ground for Imposter Syndrome. It's easy to assume the worst about your work when you don't hear otherwise.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether you check-in with employees daily through a chat app, schedule weekly video sessions, or meet in-person monthly, the key is to provide continuous feedback rather than combining it all into one surprising review at the end of the year. Hold performance-oriented discussions in private, not in public. We share praise in public, and keep negative feedback to 1:1. </p>
<p>On weekly team meetings, you should decide, together with the team as much as possible, what is the best use of your time toward accomplishing objectives. You can expect and schedule a 1-on-1 once every month with your manager to further refine your objectives and to request support with any challenge you might face.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Measure Output.</strong> The underlying message is to find a metric outside of hours spent to evaluate productivity. We use a combination of OKRs and Performance Reviews to evaluate. OKRs are used to clearly articulate the priority of the tasks and enforce alignment towards Company objectives. Performance Reviews start with Self-evaluations, seeking feedback through peers and managers on the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the work as expected to the Job Roles and Responsibilities. </p>
<p>Every quarter we commit to do a 1-on-1 to review our performance and use the same structure to help each of us set career and personal goals. We commit to helping each other achieve these as much as it is within our power to do so.</p>
<p>Work is part of life, not the other way around. We do pledge <a href="https://github.com/TheEnigmaticT/modern_open_culture/#flexibility-and-individual-commitment">Flexibility and Individual Commitment</a> to accomplish the work that you've agreed to publicly accomplish, and the OKRs that you've agreed to be responsible for. </p>
<p>If you can't hit a goal this week, tell your team leaders  . We don't demand 110% commitment  all the time because 1) it's impossible and 2) that's how we burn out. </p>
<p>If you fail at them, we can have a look at why, and refine either your approach, or revise the team agreement into something more reasonable. If you fail to uphold your commitments a second time, that’s a red flag and it’s worth a more serious discussion; however, it will be in the spirit of helping you fit in the team and processes better.</p>
<p>If you fail often and repeatedly, you will be asked to leave the team. As such, we do not ask someone to leave lightly. Firing someone is something we view as the worst possible outcome in a work relationship. However, keeping someone that is underperforming, or doesn’t fit the team, is damaging to the work of everyone else in the company. This is a case where we must place the many above the few.</p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#saying-goodbye" id="saying-goodbye">Saying Goodbye</a></h1>
<p>At MayaData we are on a multi-year journey during which our products, our customers, our market, our community - and yes the macroeconomic and public health environment - are all undergoing changes.  It would be <em>unreasonable</em> to expect that the company would not also undergo changes; it would also be <em>unfair</em> to assume stasis, <em>unfair</em> to ourselves and our customers and users and all other stakeholders if we didn’t reexamine ourselves critically in order to constantly improve MayaData.</p>
<p>At MayaData, having ourselves committed to <a href="https://github.com/mayadata-io/culture/blob/master/plow.md#people-first">People First</a>, it is very challenging and even feels unpleasant to say Goodbyes. However, People First with our other values in PLOW with the imperative of growing and evolving the company is to recognize that the team is of greater importance than any individual.</p>
<p>At MayaData, our policy is to be the preferred place to work in our markets for individuals that want to cast themselves into the tumult and opportunity of a start-up in order to achieve our mission.  We compete for the best and brightest not via cash and other compensation alone - but via mission, culture, opportunity, and challenge.</p>
<p>Goodbyes are inevitable. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>At a certain point, individuals will no longer fit with the team.  Perhaps they’ll decide that MayaData no longer helps them grow in the way they feel is best.  Or perhaps they’ll be recruited to by an enormous organization - and they’ll decide that start-up life is no longer compatible with the kind of life they want for themselves.  Maybe they’ve developed themselves all they want or need and in some cases personal circumstances cause them to value stability over growth and opportunity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Or, perhaps MayaData will decide that the individual is no longer the best fit for MayaData.  No company or organization has unlimited funds or resources.  Every organization must decide where to spend scarce resources in order to achieve challenging goals.  Unfortunately, this can mean deciding that some of the team members that helped us in the past are no longer a fit for us in the future. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In either case, our policy is to bid the individual a swift adieu - to say thank you and Godspeed. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>A lingering end to the relationship of an individual with a team puts at risk the cohesion of the team and closes off opportunities for growth for those that remain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Specifically, our policy is to pay a reasonable transition to those that we ask to leave the company and not expect them to continue to work with us during that time; while some transition time may be required and helpful, the shock of change is part of what catalyzes a team to take a new approach to new and old problems. Similarly, while we appreciate that it is customary to give notice when resigning from an organization, this does not mean that we want employees that have left the team to continue to take up space, opportunity, resources, and time once they have decided to move on. </p>
<p>In short - we seek to enable a transition to occur within one day or at most a week.</p>
<p>While respecting and making the transition very swift for the outgoing team member, the rest of the team pulls themselves quickly together to look at reality directly - the objectives are the same or even more daunting, and now one of your own is no longer with us.  What are we going to do about it?  What are you going to do to step up and help the work happen better, faster, with a tighter alignment to our mission and immediate goals?</p>
<p>Here are some guidelines for managing the Goodbyes. </p>
<ul>
<li>Openness is one of our values. In the case of Goodbyes, we opt to share the feedback only with peers and reports of the person since we balance Openness with our value of People first and negative is 1-1.  Goodbyes can be painful, may be a learning opportunity for some, but should not be a point of gossip for anyone. If the departing team member gives their manager permission to share that information then the manager will share while making the departure announcement on the team call. We want all team-members to be engaged, happy and fulfilled in their work and if the requirements of the job or the role itself are not fulfilling we wish our team members the best of luck in their next endeavor.</li>
<li>When dealing with involuntary Goodbyes certain information can be shared. Some team members do not thrive or enjoy the work that they were hired to do. For example after starting at MayaData a team member quickly learns they have no desire or interest to work on Infrastructure products. This doesn't make them a bad person, it just means they don't have the interest for the role and based on that the decision was made to exit the company. Again, we want all team members to enjoy and thrive in their work and that may or may not be at MayaData.</li>
<li>If someone is let go involuntarily, this generally cannot be shared since it affects the individual's privacy and job performance is intentionally kept between an individual and their manager. If you are not close to an employee's offboarding, it may seem unnecessarily swift. According to our values negative feedback is 1-1 between you and your manager and we are limited in what we can share about private employee issues. Please discuss any concerns you have about another employee's offboarding with your manager.</li>
<li>In both types of Goodbyes, we follow the guidelines outlined by the local laws. For example in the US, a Separation and Release of Claims Agreement needs to be signed between the ex-team member and their people manager prior to releasing the separation pay. People manager will consult the HR and legal teams prior to executing the Goodbyes. </li>

<h1><a class="header" href="#product-support" id="product-support">Product Support</a></h1>
<p>The success of the Company and Product depends on the users. Everyone in the company is responsible for supporting the users. </p>
<ul>
<li>The users for the product include the open source community, partners and paying customers. Everyone in the company will work towards establishing credibility with the users.</li>
<li>Everyone will have an opportunity to volunteer to be the point of contact for a day (or half a day?) for OpenEBS and StorageSIG.</li>
<li>Engineers from all teams will take turns answering questions, updating users by name as we complete issues, and welcoming new users and more.</li>
<li>Engineers will be evaluated in part on their work when they are the point for a day or half a day - and for their responsiveness when an issue is brought to their attention.</li>
</ul>
<p>User onboard audit
Purpose:</p>
<p>Onboarding users is critical for any business or community - and especially for a project such as OpenEBS and a company such as MayaData for a number of reasons including:
Limited time: Our users are busy - and they try us out typically on their own time to gain understanding and trust before using our software and software services at work
Product and brand promise:  OpenEBS is known as the easiest to use and deploy solution for turning Kubernetes itself into a data plane.  If this capability erodes then we violate our brand promise, and disappoint users and lose their trust.<br />
Self adoption model:  Unlike vendors selling technology into enterprises from a prior era - , our approach is similar to that of GitLab or Atlassian or PagerDuty or GitHub or countless others - our solution must be self adopted and used in production typically before we even speak to the user.  Our entire model, from IO in the user space to the branding of the Mule for the OpenSource community to the attributes we look for and reenforce in our team, is based on self adoption.  Without effective self adoption we have built the wrong company, team, product, brand and other investments and commitments.</p>
<p>In short, poor self adoption is an existential threat.</p>
<p>This narrative suggest an approach to ensuring that we continue to evolve in the direction of improved ease of self adoption via a rhythm of user onboard audits.</p>
<p>Proposal:</p>
<p>With each monthly release we will convene a cross functional team - whose members will rotate as described below - in order to perform the self adoption audit.</p>
<p>The specifics of the self adoption audit will evolve with experience.  Each team and each sprint will add or subtract components as they feel reasonable.</p>
<p>In all cases, the self adoption audit will highlight, document, and prioritize areas that could reasonably be assumed to impede the self adoption of our target persona - an engineer that understands enough about Kubernetes to have adopted it or to be running software in an environment based upon Kubernetes.</p>
<p>The process should include everything from - how do they find out about OpenEBS and OpenEBS director to initial deployment on leading platforms to any necessary customization.  Each monthly effort and team can choose to explicitly focus on particular areas however all efforts and teams should deploy on AWS and OpenShift and D2IQ (subject to change).</p>
<p>The team should be comprised of engineering, product, marketing, and sales stakeholders.  Actual end users in the community and partners such as D2IQ can be incorporated if available as well.</p>
<p>While team members will inevitably be of different levels within MayaData, for the purposes of the monthly effort, the team should self organize.  Likely important roles that should be assumed include:
Process documentation - what are we going to do?  Where are we in our validation?<br />
Platform research - what are the likely issues we may encounter - what has changed in OpenShift, AWS, and D2IQ?
Naive user - who can free their mindsmind from all that they know about OpenEBS and actually do the work of trying out OpenEBS as if for the first time?
Results - what did we learn, how many attempts did we make, how long did it take us to achieve success?
Results integration - are all of our prioritized results on the backlog?  Are there any typos in the docs or improvements to Helm charts or other items that we can fix right away, without waiting for the next release?  Keep in mind that words such as docs and other instructions are often easier to change than code.</p>
<p>Implementation:</p>
<p>After review and improvement - this proposal should be implemented immediately.  The total duration of each audit should be part time effort for one week per month.</p>
<p>The team may want to convene via a kick off meeting with a senior sponsor such as a founder or senior technical leader.  During this 60 minutes meeting the purpose will be reviewed and the organization of the effort will be agreed upon.  At least one member of the prior month user adoption audit will attend to answer any questions.</p>
<p>The team will circle back with daily stand ups.  At the end of the week the team will issue their results in a 1-2 page write up.  They will also walk the entire company through their process and their results as a key component of our monthly all company meeting.</p>
<p>They will also participate in the nomination of the next team and will send one delegate to answer questions for the next month team as well.</p>
